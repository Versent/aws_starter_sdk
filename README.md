Thanks for trying out Marvell's AWS IoT Starter Kit. The AWS IoT Starter SDK in conjunction with the AWS IoT Starter Kit provide embedded developers a way to quickly develop and prototype Wi-Fi connected embedded products that interface with peripherals over the UART, I2C, SPI, GPIO and other such interfaces at one end, and talk to the AWS IoT service at the other.

Please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/marvell-iot/aws_starter_sdk/wiki) for getting started.
